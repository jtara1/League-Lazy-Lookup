Purpose:
1. Copy text from LoL client pre game lobby.
2. Parse into valid url for multi-search on na.op.gg
3. Go to parsed url.

Instructions:
1. Download and extract.
2. Run league-lazy-lookup.exe right after you enter the pre game lobby.

Flaws:
- resizing LoL client window will offset relative coordinates (predefined)
- it will fail to grab proper text from chat if too many people start typing before you run it
